                        <div class="text" style="margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
                            <p>Technology is a small word that has made huge impacts on our lives. Without even noticing, we use technology in many ways. It has somehow affected every single living organism on this planet. And with the many recently developments, the pace of the boom in technology has risen too. From the start of scientific discoveries till today, the human race has seen so many changes that it is uncountable. Electricity is said to be discovered in the early 18th century. Then Einstein’s theories of relativity changed the whole perspective in the 19 century. But how exactly has technology impacted us today? What changes has it made in our lives today? Has it proven to be better to be technologically civilized? Or have we made the wrong decision and inevitably going towards our doom? Today we have contrasting opinions on what the impact of technology has done to our society and generation. There are countless positive effects but at the same time we are now experiencing many negative effects of technology as well.

                            <p style="margin-top: 20px"><strong>The Positive Ways How Technology has Changed Our Lives</strong></p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                            If we take a glance around us, we see many things that are available to us only because of technology. In almost every place we go, we find light and electricity. We see electronic devices that have made work easier for us humans. Just by pressing a button our dishes are washed, our clothes are washed and our food is heated. Because of technology, pour homes are warm and cozy in the winters and cool and breezy in the summers. Because of electronic; technology, we now have refrigerators to store our food so that we can use it for longer periods of time. Talking about food, there has also been a huge development advancement in the chemical and food industry. Scientists have come up with great preservatives and methods that are used to keep food safe and give them a longer shelf life. Even milk can be stored for months. Hi tech purification plants are now being used to purify milk in an automatic way so that the vitamins and mineral are not wasted whereas all the harmful bacteria are removed. Similar water purification plants and systems have made it easier for most people to have access to cleaner better water. Then there is the field of logistics and aviation that has been influenced by technology very much. In the past centuries, ships were the only means of transport to other areas of the world. Now we have a great aviation system that can take you to any corner of the world with ease. Air travel is considered to be the safest travelling mode till date. The field of logistics deals with the delivery of goods and packages across the world. The technological advancement in aviation has given boom to this industry as well. Now businesses can easily expand their businesses worldwide and ship their products to the customers without any hassle.
                            In today’s society the one invention that has the biggest impact on our society and which has totally changed the way we work, think and process is the computer technology and internet. Computers have made processing so simple and fast. Also, when the invention was first made, a single computer needed many acres of space. However, now a computer can be as small as a palm. With the automation of many programs, we have now fewer chances of errors. The internet has provided humans across the planet with unlimited amount of information. We now have access to tons and tons of the latest research and developments. Digital information has not only given us access to new information but that information is used constructively to develop new theories and technologies.
                            The internet has changed the lives of many people around the world by offering the fastest communication modes thinkable. A picture, letter can be sent to your loved one in just seconds. With the help of technology people have become so close to their friends and families living abroad. Internet has also changes the lives of many people by offering many job opportunities that we could not even think of before internet. Outsourcing your work is made more convenient with the technological advancement of the internet.
                            When we see how doctors and physicians have made use of technology and completely altered it, we are dumbstruck. Doctors sitting thousands of miles away can control robotic arms to perform surgeries and procedures on patients. Residents take help in the same way from their mentors during difficult procedures. Also, if any groundbreaking surgery is being performed, it is telecasted live through the internet so that doctors around the world can learn the latest discovery in the field of medicine. The drugs are also developed after more research and testing which makes them more effective.

                            <p style="margin-top: 20px"><strong>The Negative Ways How Technology has Changed Our Lives</strong></p>
                            <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                            In almost every sector of our lives, technology has a huge impact not only on the society but on a personal level. But there is the side of the coin as well. While we cannot count the many bounties of technology, there are a few negative ways that it has influenced us.The biggest drawback of technology is that it is starting to take a toll on our health. With the excessive use of technology designed to make our lives easier, it has been noted that our body is beginning to show signs of retirement. The body has been designed to perform well under pressure. It starts to jam up if it is not used positively. If all our daily work chores are being done by technological devices, then we spend the day switching the television channels. Technology use is directly being linked to harmful diseases like obesity, diabetes, stress, depression, fatigue, cancer and much more.Our children no longer need parks and recreational centers to spend their time. A single computer or mobile phone is all they ask for. Internet has made us closer to the digital global community but is taking us far from our family living in the same house and our next door neighbors. Research has shown that internet has also made today’s society in able to made conversation face-to-face. They are comfortable being online and hiding behind fake identities but presenting themselves in person is becoming hard. Also, with the excessive amounts of information, there is no check or balance. Information travels at the speed of light. It is hard to differentiate the right from the wrong. Students are more inclined towards plagiarism, cheating and other unethical practices. Technology is teaching them to find a shortcut.
                            Pornography and unethical content is easily accessible to anyone having access to the internet. Without the implementation of strict regulations and consequences from the government, the society will continue to drown in the ocean of unmonitored information.Being technologically civilized is also affecting the environment which in a way affects the society. Our factories, plants, transportation means all emit harmful gases into the atmosphere that will have a huge negative impact on us. More and more natural resources are being used up fast to accommodate for the excessive needs of humans of this century. As much as we had invented technology to help us, it can now be felt that the society is being controlled by technology.

                          <p style="margin-top: 20px"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                          <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                            There is no doubt that technology affects us no matter what our status symbol is, it does no care what country, race or age I belong to. At one corner, technology is coming up with newer and faster ways to save lives while in the other corner; technology has enabled people to make more destructive bombs and guns.The level of impact that technology has on the society and an individual can vary and depends on how strong regulations are administered. There is a need to balance the use of technology so that it helps your life become easier without having any negative effects. Technology has helped us reach the stars. This clearly shows that that there are no bounds to where technology can take us and what it can do. It is important to regulate advancements in technology. It should be made sure that it is beneficial to the human race and will not be a threat to our future generations.
